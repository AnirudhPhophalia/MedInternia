# Healthcare API Documentation

## Overview
MedInternia provides a healthcare and medical learning API for patients, interns, doctors, and admins.

The backend currently supports:
- JWT-based authentication
- Cookie-backed sessions for browser clients
- Bearer-token authentication for API clients
- Role-based access control across multiple user types

## Base URL
```text
http://localhost:3000/api
```

## Authentication

The API accepts either of the following for protected routes:

- `Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>`
- `token` cookie set by the login or register response

For browser clients, the frontend stores the token in localStorage and also receives an `HttpOnly` cookie from the backend. For API clients, include the JWT in the `Authorization` header.

## User Types

- `patient`: Can manage their profile, cases, and personal medical information
- `doctor`: Can create and moderate cases, review content, and manage professional profile data
- `intern`: Can participate in learning workflows, discussions, and case reviews
- `admin`: Has elevated access for moderation and user management

> Note: The codebase contains placeholder permission entries for additional roles, but the documented and actively used user model currently centers on patient, doctor, intern, and admin accounts.

## API Endpoints

### Authentication Routes (`/api/auth`)

#### Register User
```http
POST /api/auth/register
```

Creates a new user account and returns:
- `user`
- `token`
- `refreshToken`

The response also sets authentication cookies for browser sessions.

  "password": "Test@123"
}

```
Requires authentication.

#### Update Profile
```http
PUT /api/auth/profile
```
Requires authentication.

```http
PUT /api/auth/change-password
```
Requires authentication.

> Note: the route is `PUT`, not `POST`.
